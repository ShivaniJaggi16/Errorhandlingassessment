# Error Handling
Error handling is an essential part of writing robust and reliable smart contracts. It involves handling unexpected or invalid conditions that may occur during contract execution and ensuring that the contract behaves predictably even in the presence of errors.It allows developers to handle exceptional situations and prevent unexpected behavior in their code. In the provided Solidity code, there are two common error handling mechanisms used: 'assert' and 'require'.

# Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.The program serves as a straightforward introduction to error handling in smart contracts and can act as a foundational stepping stone for more complex projects in the future that require effective error management within the contract. The provided code showcases the usage of assert() to validate a condition, require() to enforce a requirement, and revert() to revert the transaction if a condition is not met.

# Getting Started
# Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol).

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract ErrorHandling {
    
    uint public b = 4;

    function testAssert(uint num) public pure {
        assert(num != 0);
    }

    function divide(uint _numerator, uint _denominator) public pure returns (uint) {
        require(_numerator >= _denominator, "Please provide a numerator greater than or equal to the denominator");
        return _numerator / _denominator;
    }

    function mult(uint a) public view returns (uint) {
        require(a > 0, "Value of 'a' is zero. The result should not be zero.");
        return a * b;
    }
}
```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button. Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. testAssert(uint num) This function demonstrates the usage of the assert function. divide(uint _numerator, uint _denominator) This function demonstrates the usage of the revert function. It takes _numerator and _denominator parameters and performs division. If the _numerator is less than _denominator, it reverts the transaction with a custom error message stating that the numerator should be greater than the denominator. mult(uint a) This function demonstrates the usage of the require statement with a custom error message. It takes a parameter 'a' and checks if it is greater than zero using the require statement. If the condition fails, the function reverts with the provided error message. Otherwise, it performs the multiplication'a * b'and returns the result.
